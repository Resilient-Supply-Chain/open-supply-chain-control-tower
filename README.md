> **"Quantifying fragility, orchestrating defense."** 🛡️

The **AI Control Tower** is a technical reference implementation architected to operationalize the **S.257 (Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of 2025)**. This system acts as a proactive "nerve center" for U.S. supply-chain defense, specifically focused on protecting **Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)** from cascading disruptions through automated risk signal interpretation and reporting.

## 🏗️ v2.0.0 Release: Integrated Geo-RAG Intelligence

The **v2.0.0** release consolidates geospatial road-network intelligence, refined executive visualization, and S.257 policy grounding into a production-ready portfolio system.

### 🚀 Project Vision
An AI-powered control tower for U.S. SME supply-chain resilience aligned with **S.257** and **E.O. 14123**—delivering audit-ready policy intelligence and actionable geospatial disruption analysis.

### 🧩 Key Features (v2.0.0)
* **Geospatial Intelligence**: Real-road network analysis via the **OSRM API** for precise route interruption detection.
* **Advanced RAG**: Policy anchoring using **LlamaParse** to generate clean, de-noised S.257 context.
* **Dynamic Visualization**: Interactive executive dashboards with color-coded risk vectors and SME overlays.
* **Mathematical Foundation**: Haversine and geodesic distance calculations for risk-zone enforcement.

### 📐 Design Philosophy
As a **PhD in AI expert-led** project, our engineering choices prioritize mathematical rigor and auditability over generic automation:
1.  **Determinism over Hallucination**: LLMs are strictly utilized for narrative synthesis. Critical logic—such as geographic mapping and financial impact thresholding—is handled by deterministic Python tools.
2.  **Standardized Telemetry**: All incoming risk signals are normalized to a consistent $[0, 1]$ risk scoring model, allowing for cross-vector analysis (e.g., comparing a cyber-attack to a flood event).
3.  **Security-First Development**: Every contribution is cryptographically signed via SSH/GPG to ensure the integrity of the software supply chain.

## ⚖️ Policy & Legislative Alignment

This project is built to move the "Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act" from legislative text into a functional deployment.

* **S.257 (Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of 2025)**: Directly operationalizes the "Early Warning" system and "Vulnerability Mapping" mandates currently being reviewed by the House.
* **EO 14017 (America's Supply Chains)**: Aligns with the executive mandate to strengthen the resilience of critical supply chains, including high-capacity batteries and critical minerals.
* **EO 14110 (Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI)**: Adheres to the latest standards for **AI Risk Management** in critical infrastructure, ensuring transparency and robustness in autonomous decision-support.

## 📊 Example Output: High-Priority Alert (v2.0.0)

When a critical event is detected (e.g., a high-saturation soil signal in Monterey), the tower generates a structured briefing for policy makers:

```markdown
## 🚨 Supply Chain Alert (HIGH)

- 🧭 **Risk score**: 0.95
- 📍 **Location**: Monterey_Hwy68
- 🧪 **Primary driver**: Soil_Saturation_Critical
- 💰 **Estimated impact**: $15M_Day

- 🏢 **Potentially affected SMEs:**
  - 🔹 Monterey Valley Produce Co. (`MON-AG-001`) — Agriculture, Monterey County (~0.0 km from epicenter)
  - 🔹 Pacific Grove Cold Storage (`MON-COLD-002`) — Cold Storage, Monterey County (~3.1 km from epicenter)
  - 🔹 Seaside Packaging Works (`MON-PKG-002`) — Packaging, Monterey County (~4.0 km from epicenter)

### 🚚 Logistics Infrastructure Impact
- Route MON-AG-001 (Monterey Valley Produce Co. ➔ Hwy_68_East) is severed at the Hwy 68 saturation segment, stopping 100% of Peninsula deliveries.

### 🗺️ Geospatial Risk Visualization
SMEs within **15.0 km** of the soil saturation epicenter at (36.6100, -121.7800) are flagged for monitoring.
An interactive map has been generated at `outputs/V2_MONTEREY_MAP.html`.

## 🚀 Local Setup (macOS)
Follow these steps to initialize the developer preview on your local machine.

1. **Initialize Virtual Environment**
Ensure you are using Python 3.13.2 for the latest performance and security patches.

```
# Create the local closure
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Install Dependencies
Sync with Pydantic v2 and the PydanticAI framework.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
Copy the example file and replace dummy keys as needed:
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Key sources:
- **LlamaParse**: https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/ (LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY)
- **Anthropic**: https://console.anthropic.com/ (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- **Hugging Face**: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens (HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN)

4. **Run v2.0.0 Simulation**
   
Execute the baseline logic flow to generate your first resilience report.

```
python3 main.py
```
   Note: v2.0.0 includes OSRM road-network analysis and an interactive executive dashboard.
