> **"Quantifying fragility, orchestrating defense."** 🛡️

The **AI Control Tower** is a technical reference implementation architected to operationalize the **S.257 (Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of 2025)**. This system acts as a proactive "nerve center" for U.S. supply-chain defense, specifically focused on protecting **Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)** from cascading disruptions through automated risk signal interpretation and reporting.

## 🏗️ v0.0.1 Foundation: Structural Integrity

The **v0.0.1** release establishes the core end-to-end telemetry and reasoning loop. It transforms raw environmental or logistical signals into policy-aligned, structured resilience reports.

### 🧩 Core Capabilities
* **📡 Type-Safe Risk Ingestion**: Implements strict `RiskSignal` validation using **Pydantic V2**, ensuring data integrity from diverse sources such as climate events, port closures, or cyber-physical threats.
* **🛰️ Geospatial SME Triage**: A deterministic toolset that maps physical disruption coordinates (e.g., Monterey Hwy 68) to firm-level exposure recorded in the `sme_registry.json`.
* **🧠 Cognitive Synthesis (Baseline)**: An agentic framework powered by **PydanticAI** that interprets risk vectors (e.g., Soil Saturation) and generates structured Markdown alerts prioritized by impact severity.

### 📐 Design Philosophy
As a **PhD-led** project, our engineering choices prioritize mathematical rigor and auditability over generic automation:
1.  **Determinism over Hallucination**: LLMs are strictly utilized for narrative synthesis. Critical logic—such as geographic mapping and financial impact thresholding—is handled by deterministic Python tools.
2.  **Standardized Telemetry**: All incoming risk signals are normalized to a consistent $[0, 1]$ risk scoring model, allowing for cross-vector analysis (e.g., comparing a cyber-attack to a flood event).
3.  **Security-First Development**: Every contribution is cryptographically signed via SSH/GPG to ensure the integrity of the software supply chain.

## ⚖️ Policy & Legislative Alignment

This project is built to move the "Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act" from legislative text into a functional deployment.

* **S.257 (Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of 2025)**: Directly operationalizes the "Early Warning" system and "Vulnerability Mapping" mandates currently being reviewed by the House.
* **EO 14017 (America's Supply Chains)**: Aligns with the executive mandate to strengthen the resilience of critical supply chains, including high-capacity batteries and critical minerals.
* **EO 14110 (Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI)**: Adheres to the latest standards for **AI Risk Management** in critical infrastructure, ensuring transparency and robustness in autonomous decision-support.

## 📊 Example Output: High-Priority Alert

When a critical event is detected (e.g., a high-saturation soil signal in Monterey), the tower generates a structured briefing for policy makers:

```markdown
## ⚠️ Supply Chain Resilience Alert (HIGH)

- **Risk Score**: 0.95
- **Location**: Monterey_Hwy68
- **Primary Driver**: Critical Soil Saturation (Flood Risk)
- **Estimated Impact**: $15M/Day (Local Logistics)

### 📍 Potentially Affected SMEs:
- **Monterey Valley Produce Co.** (`MON-AG-001`) — Agriculture
- **Central Coast Logistics LLC** (`MON-LOG-001`) — Logistics
- **Salinas Precision Manufacturing** (`MON-MFG-001`) — Manufacturing

## 🚀 Local Setup (macOS)
Follow these steps to initialize the developer preview on your local machine.

1. **Initialize Virtual Environment**
Ensure you are using Python 3.13.2 for the latest performance and security patches.

```
# Create the local closure
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Install Dependencies
Sync with Pydantic v2 and the PydanticAI framework.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run v0.0.1 Simulation**
   
Execute the baseline logic flow to generate your first resilience report.

```
python3 main.py
```
   Note: In v0.0.1, the reasoning agent uses structural templates for reporting. Live API calls to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and integrated RAG modules are scheduled for the v0.1.0 milestone.

## 🗺️ Roadmap: The Path to v0.1.x

**Target Milestone: v0.1.0 (The Knowledge Engine) 📅 Est. Release: February 2026**

The next iteration transitions from structural verification to deep knowledge integration:

* [ ] **S.257 RAG Integration**: Ingest full legislative text to ground recommendations in specific federal assistance programs.
* [ ] **Live Reasoning Core**: Enable high-fidelity impact analysis via live Claude 3.5 Sonnet API calls.
* [ ] **Multi-Vector Signal Fusion**: Integrate real-time data feeds from **NOAA** (weather) and regional port operations (logistics).
* [ ] **NAICS Expansion**: Update `sme_registry.json` to include 6-digit NAICS codes for granular sectoral risk mapping.
